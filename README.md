Hi. I'm Igor.

First, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the people who tirelessly provide educational materials for computer graphics programming. These materials allow both beginners and professionals to improve their skills. 
I especially want to thank the author of the site learnopengl.com, as well as the authors of the book "Computer Graphics Programming in Opengl With C++".

The models for my small projects are kindly supplied by my eldest son Dmitry (a great fan of 3D modeling).

I hope soon I will improve my skills and my projects will get better, they will have shadows, skeletal animation and many other effects.

I would be very glad to meet and communicate with professionals in this area. I look forward to receiving feedback and guidance.

Best regards.
Igor Dmitriev Uzun
