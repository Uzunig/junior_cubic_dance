<p>Hi. I'm Igor.</p>
<p>First, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the people who tirelessly provide educational materials for computer graphics programming. These materials allow both beginners and professionals to improve their skills. <br />I especially want to thank the author of the site <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">learnopengl.com</a>, as well as the authors of the book <strong>"Computer Graphics Programming in Opengl With C++"</strong>.</p>
<p>The models for my small projects are kindly supplied by my eldest son Dmitry (a great fan of 3D modeling).</p>
<p>I hope soon I will improve my skills and my projects will get better, they will have shadows, skeletal animation and many other effects.</p>
<p>I would be very glad to meet and communicate with professionals in this area. I look forward to receiving feedback and guidance.</p>
